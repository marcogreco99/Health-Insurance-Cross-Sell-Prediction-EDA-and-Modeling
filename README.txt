This is my first machine learning project with the final addition of training a simple neural network.

The project revolves around a sales practice called cross selling, which involves selling an additional product to an already acquired customer.

The task of the project is to predict whether a customer of a well-known insurance company who has already taken out medical insurance will also take out car insurance with the same company.
